# iMPACT_montecarlo

Here there is the montecarlo for estimate the sustainable particle rate

It contains:
- GATE/Geant4 simulation
- C++ application with the Montecarlo

Get the package:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/baruff92/iMPACT_montecarlo.git
cd iMPACT_montecarlo/simulazioni_articolo/monte
mkdir build
cd build
Cmake ../
make
```

Instruction for running:
- GATE simulation: Coming soon...
```sh
 cd monte/build
 ./monte
```
